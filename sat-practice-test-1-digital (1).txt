The following text is from Edith Wharton’s 1905
novel The House of Mirth. Lily Bart and a companion
are walking through a park.
Lily had no real intimacy with nature, but she
had a passion for the appropriate and could be
keenly sensitive to a scene which was the fitting
background of her own sensations. The
landscape outspread below her seemed an
enlargement of her present mood, and she found
something of herself in its calmness, its breadth,
its long free reaches. On the nearer slopes the
sugar-maples wavered like pyres of light; lower
down was a massing of grey orchards, and here
and there the lingering green of an oak-grove.

of the scene.
B) It establishes that a character is experiencing an
internal conflict.

diverse elements of Peruvian society, representing his
subjects with both dignity and authenticity.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
the student’s claim?
A) Chambi took many commissioned portraits of
wealthy Peruvians, but he also produced
hundreds of images carefully documenting the
peoples, sites, and customs of Indigenous
communities of the Andes.
B) Chambi’s photographs demonstrate a high level
of technical skill, as seen in his strategic use of
illumination to create dramatic light and shadow
contrasts.
C) During his lifetime, Chambi was known and

Alicia Montesinos-Navarro, Isabelle Storer, and Rocío Perez-Barrales
recently examined several plots within a diverse plant community in
southeast Spain. The researchers calculated that if individual plants
were randomly distributed on this particular landscape, only about 15%
would be with other plants in patches of vegetation. They counted the
number of juvenile plants of five species growing in patches of
vegetation and the number growing alone on bare ground and
compared those numbers to what would be expected if the plants were
randomly distributed. Based on these results, they claim that plants of
these species that grow in close proximity to other plants gain an
advantage at an early developmental stage.
Which choice best describes data from the table that support the
researchers’ claim?
A) For all five species, less than 75% of juvenile plants were growing in
patches of vegetation.
B) The species with the greatest number of juvenile plants growing in
patches of vegetation was H. stoechas.
C) For T. libanitis and T. moroderi, the percentage of juvenile plants
growing in patches of vegetation was less than what would be
expected if plants were randomly distributed.
D) For each species, the percentage of juvenile plants growing in
patches of vegetation was substantially higher than what would be
expected if plants were randomly distributed.

In the mountains of Brazil, Barbacenia tomentosa
and Barbacenia macrantha—two plants in the
Velloziaceae family—establish themselves on soilless,
nutrient-poor patches of quartzite rock. Plant
ecologists Anna Abrahão and Patricia de Britto Costa
used microscopic analysis to determine that the roots
of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha, which grow
directly into the quartzite, have clusters of fine hairs
near the root tip; further analysis indicated that these
hairs secrete both malic and citric acids. The
researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on
dissolving underlying rock with these acids, as the
process not only creates channels for continued
growth but also releases phosphates that provide the
vital nutrient phosphorus.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
the researchers’ hypothesis?
A) Other species in the Velloziaceae family are
found in terrains with more soil but have root
structures similar to those of B. tomentosa and
B. macrantha.
B) Though B. tomentosa and B. macrantha both
secrete citric and malic acids, each species
produces the acids in different proportions.
C) The roots of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha
carve new entry points into rocks even when
cracks in the surface are readily available.
D) B. tomentosa and B. macrantha thrive even when
transferred to the surfaces of rocks that do not
contain phosphates.

Herbivorous sauropod dinosaurs could grow more
than 100 feet long and weigh up to 80 tons, and some
researchers have attributed the evolution of
sauropods to such massive sizes to increased plant
production resulting from high levels of atmospheric
carbon dioxide during the Mesozoic era. However,
there is no evidence of significant spikes in carbon
dioxide levels coinciding with relevant periods in
sauropod evolution, such as when the first large
sauropods appeared, when several sauropod lineages
underwent further evolution toward gigantism, or
when sauropods reached their maximum known
sizes, suggesting that _______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) fluctuations in atmospheric carbon dioxide

B) the evolution of larger body sizes in sauropods

C) atmospheric carbon dioxide was higher when the

the first sauropods appeared.
D) sauropods probably would not have evolved to

Text 1

Most animals can regenerate some parts of their
bodies, such as skin. But when a three-banded
panther worm is cut into three pieces, each piece
grows into a new worm. Researchers are
investigating this feat partly to learn more about
humans’ comparatively limited abilities to
regenerate, and they’re making exciting progress. An
especially promising discovery is that both humans
and panther worms have a gene for early growth
response (EGR) linked to regeneration.
Text 2

When Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that
panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR,
it caused excitement. However, as the team pointed
out, the gene likely functions very differently in
humans than it does in panther worms. Srivastava
has likened EGR to a switch that activates other
genes involved in regeneration in panther worms,
but how this switch operates in humans remains
unclear.
Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 2
most likely say about Text 1’s characterization of the
discovery involving EGR?
A) It is reasonable given that Srivastava and her
team have identified how EGR functions in both
humans and panther worms.
B) It is overly optimistic given additional
observations from Srivastava and her team.
C) It is unexpected given that Srivastava and her
team’s findings were generally met with
enthusiasm.
D) It is unfairly dismissive given the progress that
Srivastava and her team have reported.

Weary with toil, I [hurry] to my bed,
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;
But then begins a journey in my head
To work my mind, when body’s work’s expired:
For then my thoughts—from far where I abide—
[Begin] a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,

The following text is adapted from Lewis Carroll’s
1889 satirical novel Sylvie and Bruno. A crowd has
gathered outside a room belonging to the Warden,
an official who reports to the Lord Chancellor.
One man, who was more excited than the rest,
flung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as
well as I could make out) “Who roar for the
Sub-Warden?” Everybody roared, but whether it
was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly
appear: some were shouting “Bread!” and some
“Taxes!”, but no one seemed to know what it was
they really wanted.
All this I saw from the open window of the
Warden’s breakfast-saloon, looking across the
shoulder of the Lord Chancellor.
“What can it all mean?” he kept repeating to
himself. “I never heard such shouting
before—and at this time of the morning, too!
And with such unanimity!”
Based on the text, how does the Lord Chancellor
respond to the crowd?
A) He asks about the meaning of the crowd’s
shouting, even though he claims to know what
the crowd wants.
B) He indicates a desire to speak to the crowd, even
though the crowd has asked to speak to the
Sub-Warden.
C) He expresses sympathy for the crowd’s demands,
even though the crowd’s shouting annoys him.
D) He describes the crowd as being united, even
though the crowd clearly appears otherwise.

O Pioneers! is a 1913 novel by Willa Cather. In the
novel, Cather portrays Alexandra Bergson as having
a deep emotional connection to her natural
surroundings: _______
Which quotation from O Pioneers! most effectively
illustrates the claim?
A) “She had never known before how much the
country meant to her. The chirping of the insects
down in the long grass had been like the sweetest
music. She had felt as if her heart were hiding
down there, somewhere, with the quail and the
plover and all the little wild things that crooned
or buzzed in the sun. Under the long shaggy
ridges, she felt the future stirring.”
B) “Alexandra talked to the men about their crops
and to the women about their poultry. She spent
a whole day with one young farmer who had
been away at school, and who was experimenting
with a new kind of clover hay. She learned a
great deal.”
C) “Alexandra drove off alone. The rattle of her
wagon was lost in the howling of the wind, but
her lantern, held firmly between her feet, made a
moving point of light along the highway, going
deeper and deeper into the dark country.”
D) “It was Alexandra who read the papers and
followed the markets, and who learned by the
mistakes of their neighbors. It was Alexandra
who could always tell about what it had cost to
fatten each steer, and who could guess the weight
of a hog before it went on the scales closer than
John Bergson [her father] himself.”

different Eurasian languages are typically spoken
(in syllables per second) and how much information
they can effectively convey (in bits per second). They
found that, although languages vary widely in the
speed at which they are spoken, the amount of
information languages can effectively convey tends
to vary much less. Thus, they claim that two
languages with very different spoken rates can
nonetheless convey the same amount of information
in a given amount of time.

Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt
have argued that experiencing awe—a sensation of
reverence and wonder typically brought on by
perceiving something grand or powerful—can enable
us to feel more connected to others and thereby
inspire us to act more altruistically. Keltner, along
with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims
to have found evidence for this effect in a recent
study where participants were asked to either gaze up
at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported
to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare
at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building.
After one minute, an experimenter deliberately
spilled a box of pens nearby.
Which finding from the researchers’ study, if true,
would most strongly support their claim?
A) Participants who had been looking at the trees
helped the experimenter pick up significantly
more pens than did participants who had been
looking at the building.
B) Participants who helped the experimenter pick
up the pens used a greater number of positive
words to describe the trees and the building in a
postexperiment survey than did participants who
did not help the experimenter.
C) Participants who did not help the experimenter
pick up the pens were significantly more likely to
report having experienced a feeling of awe,
regardless of whether they looked at the building
or the trees.
D) Participants who had been looking at the
building were significantly more likely to notice
that the experimenter had dropped the pens than
were participants who had been looking at the
trees.

Many archaeologists will tell you that categorizing
excavated fragments of pottery by style, period,
and what objects they belong to relies not only on
standard criteria, but also on instinct developed
over years of practice. In a recent study, however,
researchers trained a deep-learning computer model
on thousands of images of pottery fragments and
found that it could categorize them as accurately as a
team of expert archaeologists. Some archaeologists
have expressed concern that they might be replaced
by such computer models, but the researchers claim
that outcome is highly unlikely.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
the researchers’ claim?
A) In the researchers’ study, the model was able to
categorize the pottery fragments much more
quickly than the archaeologists could.
B) In the researchers’ study, neither the model nor
the archaeologists were able to accurately
categorize all the pottery fragments that were
presented.
C) A survey of archaeologists showed that
categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount
of time they can dedicate to other important
tasks that only human experts can do.
D) A survey of archaeologists showed that few of
them received dedicated training in how to
properly categorize pottery fragments.

Birds of many species ingest foods containing
carotenoids, pigmented molecules that are converted
into feather coloration. Coloration tends to be
especially saturated in male birds’ feathers, and
because carotenoids also confer health benefits,
the deeply saturated colors generally serve to
communicate what is known as an honest signal of
a bird’s overall fitness to potential mates. However,
ornithologist Allison J. Shultz and others have found
that males in several species of the tanager genus
Ramphocelus use microstructures in their feathers to
manipulate light, creating the appearance of deeper
saturation without the birds necessarily having to
maintain a carotenoid-rich diet. These findings
suggest that _______
